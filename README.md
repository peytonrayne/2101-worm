Final project for Fullstack Academy 2101 Cybersecurity Program

This project was created by Peyton Rayne, Greg Randal, and Kate Ryan as part of Fullstack Academy Cyber Bootcamp.
It is meant for learning purposes only, and is likely incapable of causing harm to an unprepared sysyem.
Still, proceed at your own risk if you wish to use any code within.
